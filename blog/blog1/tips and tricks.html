    Its been a hard journey but finally i got my dream of growing my channel but alas as we see every good thing has an end  .

    <!-- this is content section -->
    <div class="youtube-image">

      <p><img src="./image/youtube.jpg " style="  max-width: 100%; width: 500px;" alt="" float="centre"></p>

    </div>

    <p>At first when i was starting i ve got a strike at my every attemt of uploading a video , because i ve always use
      popular copyright
      content . and i didn't either know about tags and the use of analystics to grow a channel.

    </p>
    <p>though nowadays google give a opportunity of googleads by paying google we can promote our videos . by which our
      content can be promoted to wider audience than usual .
      its been always a challenge but the will and the support of your lovers and youtube family members will keep you
      going.
      due to the use of many copyright content , my channel can"t be monitise or i can't arn money due to which my
      motivation alwayes going down . but when i see people loves my content and appreciates what i ve done , its all
      made me pumped and hyped for the next day to come.
      as i was speakin when i got 10k subscribers youtube giftes me with a copyright strike on my other channel lol..
    </p>
    <p>Well with my whole experience i will share you top 6 tricks that can make you channel grow at the speed of light
      xd. my channel is a anime based channel where i usually upload many types of anime stuffs.</p>

    <h2>1 . Make A Single Type Of Channel</h2>

    <img src="./image/second.jpg" style="  max-width: 100%; width: 500px;" alt="image">

    <p>So you want to upload videos on YouTube and you’re ready to start a channel. You go to the settings, you give
      your channel a name, and then there’s this thing called Channel Type. You click on it and there’s these six
      options that come up. How do you know which one is right for you? Well, chances are if you’re content is going to
      be specific, you’ll have no problem choosing. But maybe your content doesn’t quite fit into one specific category.
      How do you know which one to choose? Does it even matter? Well, YouTube hasn’t quite ironed this out to be as
      useful as it could be, but it’s good to know what type of channel you want to be associated with, for reasons
      other than the obvious.
      When creating a channel on YouTube, you get several options under “Channel Type.” Those types are: YouTuber,
      Director, Musician, Comedian, Guru, and Reporter. These all seem self-explanatory, but they all have their own
      options. Perhaps you want to do comedy, but have the Director Type. And if your comedy isn’t original content, you
      won’t be able to use the Comedian Type, because that is for original content only.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>2 . Use Tags</h2>
    </p>

    <img src="./image/tags.png" style="  max-width: 100%; width: 500px;" alt="" />

    <p>Newbie in the youtube just leave the tags option and moves on a head. tags are those words which on the bases of
      which your video recommended on youtube.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>3 . Use Google Ads Features</h2>
    </p>

    <img src="./image/ads.jpg" style="  max-width: 100%; width: 500px;" alt="iamge">

    <p>This feature or you can say tool is most affective of all but you to pay for it . well if you likes to invest you
      can use the google ads feature yo make your video appears as ads on the home screen of youtube but it marks as ad
      so many peoples skip it too xd.Google Ads is an online advertising platform developed by Google, where advertisers
      pay to display brief advertisements, service offerings, product listings, video content, and generate mobile
      application installs within the Google ad network to web users.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>4 . Contact Copyright Owner For Retraction</h2>
    </P>

    <img src="./image/claim.jpg" style="  max-width: 100%; width: 500px;" alt="image" />

    <p>If you uses copyright contents like anime clips , movie clips , songs or any material which is not uploaded are
      creative commons , the owner can gives you a strike on 3 strikes your channel will be deleted , banned or
      terminated .
      so solution is when ever you ve got a strike by the owner of the content , just email him to retreat its strikes .
      bluntly said if you you are lucky enough he will forgive you . instead of doing nothing you can atleast try .
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>5 . Don't Use Other Youtubers Blood Sweat And Tears</h2>
    </p>

    <img src="./image/hardwork.png" style="  max-width: 100%; width: 500px;" alt="image">

    <p>Nowadays its a trend new channels appears a lots of gaming ones they just copy the big youtubers streaming clips
      and promotes them negatively and which causes hate and rumors.
      as of creator myself i m pleading plz don't use anyone one's content they can give you a strike too . show some
      humor and asks them to use their content via mail or dm's .
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>6 . Promote Your Channel Through Social Media</h2>
    </p>

    <img src="./image/pinterest.jpg" style="  max-width: 100%; width: 500px;" alt="image">

    <p>As you can see instagram and tik tok are of huge trend , if you can exploit its popularity then promote your
      video on these medias. it creates lots of difference many will recognise your video .
      will many will despise just stay focused and keep going . no problem if you got no views or watching if you are
      good than a time come by 1 to 1 million their is a family which will supports you more than your real family .
    </p>
